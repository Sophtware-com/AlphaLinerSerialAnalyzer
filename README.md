## What is an AlphaLiner

An AlphaLiner is an industrial machine used in printing and packaging lines, typically for inserting, collating, or handling printed materials such as magazines, newspapers, or direct mail. It automates the process of feeding, aligning, and assembling inserts or supplements into main products, improving speed, accuracy, and efficiency in high-volume production environments.

## Analyzer Notes

- The letter **J** stands for Jacket and indicates if the pocket wheel is configured with a setting.
- The original PDF protocol documentation converted to markdown is included below (not perfect).
- This analyzer can be used to analyze data streams coming from or going to the AlphaLiner
- Not all protocol methods have been implemented (only the critical ones for collating)
- Output format ```METHOD_NAME PACKET_SEQUENCEùëõ (DETAILS)```
- Both ACK and NAK can be hidden so they don't show in the display or export with table data.

## Hardware

AlphaLiner ‚ÄúB&R PLC 2005‚Äù communication via serial point-to-point connection with the control system.

The following interface types are available:

*   **At the CPU:**
    *   RS422/485/TTY 347 kBaud / 4‚Äô800 baud (TTY)
    *   RS 232 57‚Äô600 baud (PG interface)
*   **At the interface module IF 050:**
    *   RS422/485 347 kBaud
    *   RS232 modem 64 kBaud
    *   RS232/TTY 64 kBaud / 4800 baud (TTY)

For cost and performance reasons, the connection via the RS422/485 or the RS232 interface is implemented in the CPU (no additional module is required). The PC requires a converter using the RS232 interface to connect to the RS422/485. The baud rate is set to 19‚Äô200.

## Telegram Data Format

*   1 start bit
*   8 data bits
*   1 parity bit, odd parity
*   1 stop bit

### Character Format

*   **Control characters** (ACK, NAK, STX, ETX) are transferred as actual characters.
*   **Data characters** (C1, C2, D1 .. Dn) the MSB (most significant bit) is always set, data range is between 0 - 127, but physically characters are transmitted between 128 - 255. A definite distinction between control characters and data characters is guaranteed.
*   The block check character is treated specially.

## Message Format

Data transfer begins with STX and ends with ETX and checksum. The first characters of the data block (C1) is a continuous message number, the second character (C2) identifies the message

`STX CHR(2) C1 CHR(128)..CHR(255) C2 CHR(128)..CHR(255) D1..Dn CHR(128)..CHR(255) BCC Block Check Character ETX CHR(3)`

### Message Number (C1)

The message number is increased sequentially with each outgoing message by one. If the message is not acknowledged with NAK or otherwise, the message number remains the same. The message number is between 0 and 127. The MSB is set always to distinguish the data from the control character.

### Message Number (C2)

The address range for the messages is between 0 and 127. The identification is transmitted with the character C2. The identification defines the message content. The MSB is set always to distinguish the data from the control character.

### Data (D1..Dn)

The data are always transferred in bytes between 128 and 255 but the effective range is between 0 . . 127 . The MSB is set always to distinguish the data from the control character.

### Block Check Characters (BCC)

The block check character is defined by an XOR operation calculated on the above defined string. The character is treated as a control character but at one of the following values it increments by one. Thus prevents from any confusion with the true control characters.

Reserved characters are:

*   STX CHR(2)
*   ETX CHR(3)
*   ACK CHR(6)
*   NAK CHR(21)
*   NUL CHR(0)

### Acknowledgement

Each message is acknowledged with ACK or NAK.

*   Successful transmission: ACK CHR (6)
*   Faulty transmission: NAK CHR (21)

## Telegram

This chapter describes all the necessary messages to connect the AlphaLiner with the control system.

**Attention!** For all data characters C and D, the MSB must be set always.

### Connection PC to AlphaLiner Manual Mode (local)

*   **Function:** Controls the Alphaliner in manual operation. The connection to the PC retains, but there are only error messages exchanged.
*   **C2 - code:** 01
*   **Data:** None
*   **Response:** The AlphaLiner updates the error messages and sends its status back, which shows either that the machine is in manual mode or in an undefined state (see status message).
*   **Note:** The manual mode (local make ready mode) is selected from the PC controller.

### Auto Mode (remote)

*   **C2 - code:** 02
*   **Data:** None
*   **Response:** The AlphaLiner updates the error messages and sends its status back, which shows either that the machine is in manual mode or in an undefined state (see ‚ÄúStatus Message‚Äù).

### Diagnostic Mode

*   **Function:** If the AlphaLiner is switched in to diagnostic mode, the AlphaLiner starts a self test procedure. By means of a data byte it can distinguish between different test procedures. Error messages continue to be transmitted to the PC.
*   **C2 - code:** 03
*   **Data:** D1, D2: Reserved bytes for accurate test specifications
*   **Data Format:**
    *   D1: The bits in D1 have the following meanings:
        *   Bit 0: Test Missfeed photocell. On event, Missfeed photocell activated, the associated error light turns on.
        *   Bit 1: Lamp test. All lights flashing on the machine.
        *   Bit 2: Double detector test. Turns on the cyclical transmission of the double detector data from a feeder. The feeder number is transmitted with D2.
    *   D2: Feeder number 0 . .30 (0 = jacket feeder).
*   **Response:** The AlphaLiner updates the error messages and sends its status back, which indicates that the machine is switched to diagnose or that the machine is in an undefined state (see ‚ÄúStatus Message‚Äù).

*   **Data Format:**
    *   D1: Data IDs 0. . 30 corresponds with the feeder numbers. The remaining data is transmitted with ids ‚â• 50. The Data IDs are identical to the ‚ÄúParameter Message PC to Alphaliner‚Äù. In addition, the following data are known.
        *   100: Application configuration file (2,3), software (5), PG - version (6.7), software - index (8)
        *   101: Day (2), month (3), year (4, 5), bug fix - version (6,7)
        *   102: Release (2,3), frame driver version (4.5), RIOVersion
        *   103: Online data for testing purposes: Offset by TR (2) MJ (3), inserts (4), removal (5), number of pockets (6), gripper number (7.8)
        *   104: Project (2.3)
    *   D2.. D8: 7 byte data into 7 - BYTE, WORD - 3 and 1 BYTE, 1 LONG and 1 BYTE variable or a combination thereof. A WORD variable (16 - bit) is divided into two bytes each at 7 bits (MSB is reserved). The range of values is a result by lower two bits (0.. 65535 instead of 0 .. 16383). This restriction leads to no problems, since the values in each case will be smaller than 16383. The same procedure applies to BYTE and LONG. The transfer of the entire parameter data goes always with a status message with data set, ready bit completed (monitoring of data consistency).
*   **Response:** None

### Double Detector Test Messages

*   **Function:** This message transmits the measured values from the PLC of the Doublefeed control. These values can be provided with the test software (RECORD REPLAY) or with the AlphaLiner configuration software.
*   **C2 code:** 120
*   **Data:** D1: Feeder number, sensor number, copy available, D2, D3: value of the thickness measurement, D4, D5: Calculated mean, D6: Status
*   **Data Format:**
    *   D1: Feeder number (0. .30 ). Bit 6 is the sensor number (0. . 1). Bit 5 indicates whether a copy was pulled off or not (gripper empty or full).
    *   D2, D3: Value of the thickness measurement
    *   D4, D5: Calculated mean. If a copy is available is the mean value of the full gripper, otherwise the empty gripper is transmitted.
    *   D6: If a faulty copy is detected by the PLC, the bit 0 is set in D6.
*   **Response:** None
